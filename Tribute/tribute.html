            <p id="mini-head"> A brief history about the life of Dr. Nkrumah:
                <ul>
                    <li>Kwame Nkrumah was a Ghanaian politician and revolutionary.<br>
                     He was the first Prime Minister and President of Ghana, having led the Gold Coast to independence from Britain in 1957.</li>

                    <li>An influential advocate of pan-Africanism, Nkrumah was a founding member of the Organization of African Unity and winner of the Lenin Peace Prize from the Soviet Union in 1962.</li>

                    <li>After twelve years abroad pursuing higher education, developing his political philosophy and organizing with other diasporic pan-Africanists, Nkrumah returned to the Gold Coast to begin his political career as an advocate of national independence. Through the formation of the CPP political party. And thus voted into power as the President.</li>

                    <li>His administration was primarily socialist as well as nationalist. <br> 
                    It funded national industrial and energy projects, developed a strong national education system and promoted a pan-Africanist culture.</li>

                    <li>In 1964, a constitutional amendment made Ghana a one-party state, with Nkrumah as president for life of both the nation and its party. Nkrumah was deposed in 1966 by the National Liberation Council which under the supervision of international financial institutions privatized many of the country's state corporations.</li>
                
                    <li>Nkrumah lived the rest of his life in Guinea, of which he was named honorary co-president.</li>
                </ul> <br>

                <blockquote>“I am not African because I was born in Africa but because Africa was born in me”.</blockquote>
